## Project Title: 
Revamping Mario 3D Game using Unity 3D

## Problem Statement: 
The super mario game was first released in 1985. 
It is the best-selling video game franchise of all time, with more than 758.06 million copies of games sold till 2020.
The popularity reduced over time because the game didn’t introduce multiplayer and couldn’t evolve with time.
Now it’s time to re engage the lost customers through AR/VR.


## Added Functionalities : 
We have made a score calculator and added lifes by collecting different types of fruits.
